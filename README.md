Hey,

Let's go to create a simple project for API Testing.
First of all, you have downloading/clone this project for your PC and to install all dependencies. Okay?

Do you have bundler installed? If not, you can know how to install in this link: http://bundler.io/
It simplify your life for installing all dependencies.

bundle install

Now you have this project on your PC and all dependencies are installed.
Let's understand  each file!

# FILE: GemFile

In this file we have all dependencies that we need for testing our api!
Any dependency that you need you can put in this file, It will help when exporting your project!

# FILE: api-testing.rb

Here, we have all tests that we need for testing our api(POST, GET, PUT and DELETE).
In this project i am testing a API that i have created and you can see here: https://github.com/nathsilv/api-node
This api is about series and it is simple!
For you testing this project, you will need the API, so downloading that api-node project too! and Enjoy!

# How to run my tests?

First, up your API server(In my api-node project in my github i show how to up the server if you don't know it)
Then, in the project directory execute: rspec api-testing.rb
Simple, Isn't It?

Any doubt you have, you can contact me and let's go to talk about it!
