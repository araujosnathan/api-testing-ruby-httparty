# api-testing-ruby-httparty

Hey,

Let's go to create a simple project for API Testing. </br>
First of all, you have downloading/clone this project for your PC and to install all dependencies. Okay?

Do you have bundler installed? If not, you can know how to install in this link: http://bundler.io/ </br>
It simplify your life for installing all dependencies.

# Dependencies

* gem "httparty"</br>
* gem "rspec"

# How to install

* git clone https://github.com/nathsilv/api-testing-ruby-httparty.git </br>
* bundle install

Now you have this project on your PC and all dependencies are installed. </br>
Let's understand  each file!

# FILE: GemFile

In this file we have all dependencies that we need for testing our api!</br>
Any dependency that you need you can put in this file, It will help when exporting your project!

# FILE: api-testing.rb

Here, we have all tests that we need for testing our api(POST, GET, PUT and DELETE).</br>
In this project i am testing a API that i have created and you can see here: https://github.com/nathsilv/api-node</br>
This api is about series and it is simple!</br>
For you test this project, you will need the API, so downloading that api-node project too! and Enjoy!

# How to run the tests?

First, up your API server(In my api-node project in my github i show how to up the server if you don't know it)</br>
Then, in the project directory execute: </br>
* rspec api-testing.rb</br></br>

Simple, Isn't It?</br>
